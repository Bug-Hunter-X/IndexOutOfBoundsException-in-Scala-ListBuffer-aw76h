# Scala ListBuffer IndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala: attempting to access an index in a `ListBuffer` that is out of bounds.  The provided code throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` because it tries to access an element at index 3, while the list only contains elements at indices 0, 1, and 2. The solution shows how to correctly handle this using safer methods or by checking the bounds before accessing elements.
